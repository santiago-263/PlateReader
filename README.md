# PlateReader

This Python script automates the quantification of fluorescence in ELISA plates irradiated with UV light. Given an input image, it detects each well using a configurable grid, measures average fluorescence intensity, and simulates absorbance using the Beer-Lambert relation with normalized transmittance. The results are exported as a CSV file, and an annotated image is generated for visual verification.
